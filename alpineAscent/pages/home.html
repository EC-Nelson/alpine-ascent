    <p id="first-section-quote">“Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the

        see the world, not so the world can see you.” - David McCullough Jr.</p>

        <p>Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, the sport of attaining, or attempting to attain, high points in mountainous regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb.
             Although the term is often loosely applied to walking up low mountains that offer only moderate
            difficulties, it is more properly restricted to climbing in localities where the terrain and
            weather conditions present such hazards that, for safety, a certain amount of previous
            experience will be found necessary. For the untrained, mountaineering is a dangerous pastime.</p>

        <p>Early attempts to ascend mountain peaks were inspired by other than sporting motives: to build altars or to see if spirits actually haunted once-forbidden heights, to get an overview of one’s own or a neighbouring countryside, or to make meteorological or geological observations.<br> Before the modern era, history recorded few attempts to ascend mountain peaks for the mere sake of the accomplishment. During the 18th century a growing number of natural philosophers—the scientists of their day—began making field trips into the Alps of Europe to make scientific observations. <br>The area around Chamonix, France, became a special attraction to those investigators because of the great glaciers on the Mont Blanc chain.

            Mountaineering differs from other outdoor sports in that nature alone provides the field of action—and just about all of the challenges—for the participant. Climbing mountains embodies the thrills produced by testing one’s courage, resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina to the utmost in a situation of inherent risk. Mountaineering, to a greater degree than other sports, is a group activity, with each member both supporting and supported by the group’s achievement at every stage.<br> For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the “conquest” of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfactions brought about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing proficiency, and contact with natural grandeur.</p>
